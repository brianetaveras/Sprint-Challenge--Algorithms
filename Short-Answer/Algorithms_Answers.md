#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Seems to be linear as there is only one loop :)


b) This one is quadratic because of the nested loops :)


c) Linear; because the operations run n times.

## Exercise II

Suppose that you have an n-story building and plenty of eggs. Suppose also that an egg gets broken if it is thrown off floor f or higher, and doesn't get broken if dropped off a floor less than floor f. Devise a strategy to determine the value of f such that the number of dropped + broken eggs is minimized.

Write out your proposed algorithm in plain English or pseudocode AND give the runtime complexity of your solution.

Define the function with n as a parameter
Use a binary search tree to find the floor where eggs break
once the floor is found, return
